          <h4>Version Control</h4>
          Version control is the ability to track changes made to any given files or folders, with the capacity to return to any point at which a change has been made. It is different from regular "saving" of a file because in that method the previous version is overwritten.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h4>How does Git Version Control work?</h4>
            Git tracks changes by creating a repository inside your working folder (where the files you are editing reside). It monitors the state of these files and when changes are made or new files created inside the repository it notes them. You are then able to add the changes to a staging area, after which you can "commit" them - thereby making these changes an accessible point in the future, and adding a comment describing what you did at that change point.
        </p>

          <h4>What is GitHub and who would benefit from using it?</h4>
          GitHub is a communal centre for git users. It is web-based, but rather than being hosted on one individual server (as an individual's git repository is on their computer) it is shared on a "cloud". This means that multiple people can access it and share their repositories - and access them from anywhere in the world.
          It is a particularly effective method of storing and sharing repositories for code because users can work collaboratively on projects in the same way that they make changes to their own files on their git-equipped computer at home. That is, changes can be made ("committed") and integrated back into one central version of a file - facilitating collaboration and eliminating the possibility of other people's work being overwritten with no way of retreating to a prior version of the code.
