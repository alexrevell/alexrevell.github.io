          Watching Shereef talk about how and why he set up Dev Academy has only further encouraged and inspired me to get even more stuck in to it. It's shaping up to be by far the most positive and comprehensive learning experience that I have ever had, and the fact that it looks to teach and develop us over such a broad range of facets (technical skills, inter-personal skills, self-development) further cements my belief in it as the great programme that I have been searching for.

          I have already been through the full gamit of emotions and states in this first week of Phase-0 - while almost constantly overwhelmed, I have also been challenged, frustrated, angry, elated, confused and confident, all in the space of several hours each day.
          I am really looking forward to being a part of what promises to be a very challenging but positive environment, with a real sense of community and support over the coming months.
